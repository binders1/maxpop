# Humanity's Fundamental Environmental Limits, model code

The Matlab code provided in <humanlimits.m> calculates Earth's human carrying capacity and identifies the fundamentally limiting factor, based on user inputs for climate and technology. The model is used in the paper "Humanity's Fundamental Environmental Limits" (Binder, Holdahl, Trinh and Smith, in prep). The climate data used in that paper is available in a .mat file at doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9983369.
